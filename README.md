# Poke Starters

## Description

This is a simple SPA that shows users a list of the first 3 starter Pokemon from the original generation. It was built primiarily as a way for me to practice some fundemental React concepts such as the useState hook.

## How it works

Once the page loads, a user is able to select on one of the three pokemon listed in order to learn more about that specific pokemon's Moves and Type. There is also a toggle tha enables the use of dark or light mode in the upper left corner of the page.
